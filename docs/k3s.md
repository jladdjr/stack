# K3s

## Node Requirements

Make sure that all nodes meet the [K3s node requirements](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements).

### Hardware

Nodes should have:
- 2 cores
- 1 GB of RAM

### Networking Requirements

Per the list of [K3s requirements](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements?os=debian#networking),
it seems like port `6443` may be the only inbound port that must be open
both for servers and agents.

Perform the steps in this section as `root`.

Install `iptables` with:

```bash
apt install iptables
```

Note: As root, I found that I needed to update my path to include `/usr/sbin`:

```bash
echo "export PATH=/usr/sbin:$PATH" > ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Back up your current set of iptables rules with:

```bash
mkdir ~/backups
iptables-save > ~/backups/iptables_backup_$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S").rules
```

Open port 6443 with:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6443 -j ACCEPT
```

To make sure the rules persist, run:

```bash
apt install iptables-persistent
```

During the `iptables-persistent` installation you will be asked if you would like to
save the current set of rules to `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`.
Agree to do so.

## Installing the server

Perform the steps in this section as `root`.

Following along with the instructions given [here](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/configuration#putting-it-all-together):

Create the `/etc/rancher/k3s` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/rancher/k3s
```

Create a config.yaml file at `/etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml`, containing:

```yaml
token: "<new-k3s-token>"
debug: true
```

Run the K3s installer script with:

```bash
apt install -y curl
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io \
    | K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE="644" \
      INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="server" \
      sh -s - --flannel-backend none
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
[INFO]  Finding release for channel stable
[INFO]  Using v1.28.4+k3s2 as release
[INFO]  Downloading hash https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.28.4+k3s2/sha256sum-amd64.txt
[INFO]  Downloading binary https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.28.4+k3s2/k3s

[INFO]  Skipping installation of SELinux RPM
[INFO]  Creating /usr/local/bin/kubectl symlink to k3s
[INFO]  Creating /usr/local/bin/crictl symlink to k3s
[INFO]  Creating /usr/local/bin/ctr symlink to k3s
[INFO]  Creating killall script /usr/local/bin/k3s-killall.sh
[INFO]  Creating uninstall script /usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
[INFO]  env: Creating environment file /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.env
[INFO]  systemd: Creating service file /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service
[INFO]  systemd: Enabling k3s unit
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/k3s.service â†’ /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.
[INFO]  systemd: Starting k3s
```

This creates a server with:

- A `kubeconfig` file with permissions 644
- [Flannel](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/network-options#flannel-options) backend set to none
- The token set to `secret`
- Debug logging enabled

Furthermore, it installs a `k3s` binary at `/usr/local/bin/k3s`,
and creates a symbolic link at `/usr/local/bin/kubectl` that points to `k3s`.

## Getting information about the cluster

Run `kubectl cluster-info` to confirm that the cluster is running.
You should see something similar to the following:

```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
Metrics-server is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:metrics-server:https/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
```

### Installing a dashboard

To install a dashboard, run:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
```

This will return output similar to the following:

```
namespace/kubernetes-dashboard created
serviceaccount/kubernetes-dashboard created
service/kubernetes-dashboard created
secret/kubernetes-dashboard-certs created
secret/kubernetes-dashboard-csrf created
secret/kubernetes-dashboard-key-holder created
configmap/kubernetes-dashboard-settings created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard created
deployment.apps/kubernetes-dashboard created
service/dashboard-metrics-scraper created
deployment.apps/dashboard-metrics-scraper created
```

Next, create a proxy in order to access the dashboard
(which is normally only accessible from within the cluster):

```bash
kubectl proxy
```

You will now be able to visit
http://localhost:8001/healthz

## Installing the agent

TODO: Update to move token to file

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="agent --server https://k3s.example.com --token mypassword" sh -s -
```
